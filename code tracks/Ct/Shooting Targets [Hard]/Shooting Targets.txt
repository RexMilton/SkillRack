Shooting Targets (Id-5873)

N shooting targets are placed in a two dimensional grid and their x and y co-ordinates are provided. The x and y co-ordinates are 
integer values. When a bullet is fired along a straight line (either parallel to x-axis or y-axis) it eliminates all the targets 
along it's path. Assuming a bullet can be fired from negative infinity to positive infinity along a straight line parallel to both x 
and y-axis, find the minimum number of bullets that need to be fired to eliminate all targets.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
-100 <= x, y <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines contain two integers(x and y) in each line separated by space(s).

Output Format:
The first line contains the minimum number of bullets that need to be fired to eliminate all targets.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
9
4 0
4 1
3 0
2 1
1 1
-2 0
1 2
-1 -1
-2 -1
Output:
4

Explanation:
The first bullet is fired parallel to X-axis through the line Y = 0
The second bullet is fired parallel to X-axis through the line Y = 1
The third bullet is fired parallel to X-axis through the line Y = -1
The fourth bullet is fired parallel to X-axis through the line Y = 2

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
8
2 3
-5 -1
0 4
1 2
7 2
4 0
3 5
1 1
Output:
7
