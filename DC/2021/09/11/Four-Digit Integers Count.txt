Four-Digit Integers Count
The program must accept a string S containing only nonzero digits as the input. The program must find the count of unique four-digit 
integers that can be formed using the digits in S based on the following conditions.
- Exactly four digits must be picked from the string in the same order of their occurrence.
- First 2 digits of the integer must be the same, say x.
- Last 2 digits of the integer must be the same, say y.
- The value of the digit y must be x+1.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the count of unique four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits in S.
