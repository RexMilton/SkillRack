0, 1, 4, 9, 20, 41, 84, 169, 340, .... and so on.

In the above series,
S[1] = 0
S[2] = 1
S[K] = 1*S[K-1] + 2*S[K-2] + 3, for K > 2.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains N.

Output Format:
The first line contains the Nth term in the above-mentioned series.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4

Output:
9

Explanation:
Here N=4.
So the fourth term in the above-mentioned series is 9, which is printed as the output.
