Largest Integer - Positive & Negative
The program must accept an array of N integers as the input. The program must print the largest integer X (where X > 0) such that both 
values X and -X (the integer X with negative sign) exist in the given array. If there is no such integer, then the program must print -1 
as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 1000
-10^5 <= Each integer value <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the largest integer X or -1.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
4 3 -3 6 -4

Output:
4

Explanation:
Here N=5 and the given 5 integers are 4 3 -3 6 -4.
The largest integer with the positive sign and negative sign is 4.
So 4 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6
2 2 3 -2 3 -2

Output:
2

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
4
6 7 -5 10

Output:
-1
