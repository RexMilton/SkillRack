Odd/Even Rows Pattern

The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the integer values in N lines based on the following 
conditions.
- If the row number X is odd, then the Xth row contains X consecutive odd integers sorted in ascending order.
- If the row number X is even, then the Xth row contains X consecutive even integers sorted in ascending order.
- The last integer in each row must be equal to the square of the row number X.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.

Output Format:
The first N lines contain the integer values based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5

Output:
1
2 4
5 7 9
10 12 14 16
17 19 21 23 25

Explanation:
X = 1: 1 (only 1 odd integer)
X = 2: 2 4 (2 consecutive even integers ending with 2*2)
X = 3: 5 7 9 (3 consecutive odd integers ending with 3*3)
X = 4: 10 12 14 16 (4 consecutive even integers ending with 4*4)
X = 5: 17 19 21 23 25 (5 consecutive odd integers ending with 5*5)

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
8

Output:
1
2 4
5 7 9
10 12 14 16
17 19 21 23 25
26 28 30 32 34 36
37 39 41 43 45 47 49
50 52 54 56 58 60 62 64
