Split Balanced Parentheses
The program must accept a string S as the input. The string S contains only parentheses, where each open parenthesis '(' has a matching 
close parenthesis ')'. The program must split the string S into as many substrings as possible, where the parentheses in each substring 
must be balanced.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The lines contain the substrings of S based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
()()

Output:
()
()

Explanation:
There are two balanced substrings in S.
Hence the output is
()
()

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
()((())())((()))(()(())())

Output:
()
((())())
((()))
(()(())())

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
(()(()()))()(((()))()(()))(()((()))(())())(())()

Output:
(()(()()))
()
(((()))()(()))
(()((()))(())())
(())
()
