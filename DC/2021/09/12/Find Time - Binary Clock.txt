Find Time - Binary Clock
The program must accept a matrix of size 4*8 representing a binary clock. The binary clock format is given below.
## ## ##
## ## ##
## ## ##
## ## ##
The hash symbols (#) will be having a 0 or 1.
- The first column values represent the binary representation of the first H(from top to bottom).
- The second column values represent the binary representation of the second H(from top to bottom).
- The third column values contain space.
- The fourth column values represent the binary representation of the first M(from top to bottom).
- The fifth column values represent the binary representation of the second M(from top to bottom).
- The sixth column values contain space.
- The seventh column values represent the binary representation of the first S(from top to bottom).
- The eighth column values represent the binary representation of the second S(from top to bottom).

The program must find the time T in 24-hr format (HH:MM:SS) from the given binary clock.

Input Format:
The first 4 lines contain a matrix of size 4*8 representing a binary clock.

Output Format:
The first line contains the time T in 24-hr format (HH:MM:SS) from the given binary clock.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
00 00 00
00 10 00
10 00 00
00 01 01

Output:
20:41:01

Explanation:
The given binary clock is
00 00 00
00 10 00
10 00 00
00 01 01
The decimal equivalent of 0010 (1st column) is 2.
The decimal equivalent of 0000 (2nd column) is 0.
The decimal equivalent of 0100 (4th column) is 4.
The decimal equivalent of 0001 (5th column) is 1.
The decimal equivalent of 0000 (7th column) is 0.
The decimal equivalent of 0001 (8th column) is 1.
The time in 24-hr format is 20:41:01, which is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
00 00 01
00 11 10
10 00 00
01 11 11

Output:
21:55:59

Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
