Sort Integers - Outside Square Brackets
The program must accept a list of integers where some groups of integers are enclosed within a pair square brackets. The program must 
sort(in-place) the integers that occur outside the square brackets in the given list. Then the program must print the revised list of 
integers as the output.
Note: The given list does not have nested square brackets.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Number of integers in the given list <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains a list of integers separated by a space, where some groups of integers are enclosed within a pair square brackets.

Output Format:
The first line contains the revised list of integers based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
40 20 [50 10 60] 30 [9 8 7 5 1] 15 65 25

Output:
15 20 [50 10 60] 25 [9 8 7 5 1] 30 40 65

Explanation:
The integers that occur outside the square brackets are given below.
40 20 30 15 65 25
After sorting those integers in their positions, the list becomes
15 20 [50 10 60] 25 [9 8 7 5 1] 30 40 65

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
[9 8 7 6] 5 4 3 2 [1]

Output:
[9 8 7 6] 2 3 4 5 [1]

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
123 9875 [10 50 20 30 40] 8 9

Output:
8 9 [10 50 20 30 40] 123 9875
