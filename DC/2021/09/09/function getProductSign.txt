function getProductSign
The function/method getProductSign accepts two arguments - SIZE and arr. The integer SIZE represents the size of the integer array arr.

The function/method getProductSign must return the sign of the product of all the integers in the given array.
- If the product is a positive value, then the function must return 1.
- If the product is a negative value, then the function must return -1.
- If the product is 0, then the function must return 0.

Your task is to implement the function getProductSign so that the program runs successfully.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
-100 <= Each integer value <= 100

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
-1 2 3 -4

Output:
1

Explanation:
The product of the given four integers is 24 (-1 * 2 * 3 * -4).
Here 24 is a positive value, so 1 is printed.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5
10 20 -30 4 5

Output:
-1

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
3
-6 0 -5

Output:
0
