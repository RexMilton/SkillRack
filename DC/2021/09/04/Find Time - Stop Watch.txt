Find Time - Stop Watch
In a stopwatch, there is a single button that alternately starts and stops the timer when pressing the button continuously. Initially, 
the stopwatch was turned off and the timer was set to 0. The program must accept N unique sorted integers indicating the times when the 
stopwatch button was pressed as the input. The program must print the time displayed on the stopwatch after pressing the button N times. 
If the stopwatch is still running after pressing the button N times, then the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
0 <= Each integer value <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
the first line contains the time displayed on the stopwatch after pressing the button N times or -1.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2
8 12

Output:
4

Explanation:
Here N=2 and the given two integers are 8 and 12.
The stopwatch was turned on at the time 8 and turned off at the time 12.
So the time displayed on the stopwatch after pressing the button 2 times is 4 (12 - 8).

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5
3 6 10 11 18

Output:
-1

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
4
0 3 74 87

Output:
16

Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
