Laptops & WI-FI Hotspots
The program must accept a string S as the input. The string S contains only the asterisks(*), the hash symbols(#), the hyphens(-) and 
the alphabet(L).
- Each asterisk represents a WI-FI hotspot.
- Each hash symbol represents an obstacle.
- Each hyphen represents an empty space.
- Each alphabet L represents a laptop.
Each laptop has a special feature of connecting to any Wi-Fi network from any distance away, as long as there are not any obstructions 
between the hotspot and the laptop.
For each laptop, the program must print the number of WI-FI hotspots that the laptop can connect as the output.

Note: The alphabet L always occurs at least once in the string.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the integer values representing the number of WI-FI hotspots that the laptop can connect.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
*---L--*---*

Output:
3

Explanation:
Here the given string is *---L--*---*.
There is only one laptop that can connect to all the three WI-FI hotspots.
So 3 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
L----*--*-#--*-L-#-*-#--L

Output:
2 1 0

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
L***#L#***L*L*

Output:
3 0 5 5
