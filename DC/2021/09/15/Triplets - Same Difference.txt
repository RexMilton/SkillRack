Triplets - Same Difference
The program must accept N sorted integers (in ascending order) as the input. The program must print all the triplets where the 
difference between the adjacent integers is the same. If there is no such triplet, then the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^6

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The lines contain the triplets where the difference between the adjacent integers is the same or the first line contains -1.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6
2 3 4 5 8 12

Output:
2 3 4
2 5 8
3 4 5
4 8 12

Explanation:
Here N=6 and the given 6 integers are 2 3 4 5 8 12.
All the triplets having the same difference between the adjacent integers are given below.
2 3 4 -> difference is 1 = (3-2) = (4-3).
2 5 8 -> difference is 3 = (5-2) = (8-5).
3 4 5 -> difference is 1 = (4-3) = (5-4).
4 8 12 -> difference is 4 = (8-4) = (12-8).

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5
5 10 20 50 100

Output:
-1
