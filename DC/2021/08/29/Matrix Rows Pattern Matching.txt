Matrix Rows Pattern Matching
The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C and a string P as the input. The string P represents a pattern for the rows of the 
matrix. The length of the string P is always equal to R, where each character from left to right represents the row of the matrix from 
top to bottom. If a character is repeated in the string P, then the corresponding rows in the matrix must be the same. The program must 
print YES if the pattern P matches the R*C matrix. Else the program must print NO as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integer values separated by a space.
The (R+2)th line contains P.

Output Format:
The first line contains YES or NO.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 4
2 8 8 3
6 8 7 2
2 8 8 3
9 6 3 4
6 8 7 2
ABACB

Output:
YES

Explanation:
Here P = "ABACB".
1st & 3rd alphabets are the same. Similarly, the 1st and 3rd rows of the matrix are the same.
2nd & 5th alphabets are the same. Similarly, the 2nd and 5th rows of the matrix are the same.
4th alphabet is not repeated. Similarly, the 4th row of the matrix is not repeated.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6 5
10 20 30 40 50
10 20 30 40 50
60 70 80 90 99
10 20 30 40 50
60 70 80 90 99
10 20 30 40 50
GGHGHK

Output:
NO

Explanation:
Here P = "GGHGHK".
1st, 2nd & 4th alphabets are the same. Similarly, the 1st, 2nd and 4th rows of the matrix are the same.
3rd & 5th alphabets are the same. Similarly, the 3rd and 5th rows of the matrix are the same.
The 6th row of the matrix is same as the 1st, 2nd and 4th row, but the alphabets K and G are different.
Hence NO is printed as the output.
