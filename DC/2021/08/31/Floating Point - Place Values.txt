Floating Point - Place Values
The program must accept a floating point value N as the input. The program must print the place values for the given floating point 
value N as shown in the Example Input/Output section.

Boundary Condition(s):
0.0 <= N <= 999999.999999

Input Format:
The first line contains N.

Output Format:
The first line contains the place values for the given floating point value N as shown in the Example Input/Output section.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
68.12

Output:
60 8 1/10 2/100

Explanation:
Here the given floating point value is 68.12.
The digit 6 is in the tenth place, so 60 is printed.
The digit 8 is in the unit place, so 8 is printed.
The digit 1 is in the one tenth place, so 1/10 is printed.
The digit 2 is in the one hundredth place, so 2/100 is printed.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
25005.9089

Output:
20000 5000 0 0 5 9/10 0 8/1000 9/10000

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
1000.0001

Output:
1000 0 0 0 0 0 0 1/10000
