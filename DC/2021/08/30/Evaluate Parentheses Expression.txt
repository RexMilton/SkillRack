Evaluate Parentheses Expression
The program must accept a string S as the input. The string S contains parentheses and integers, where each open parenthesis '(' has a 
matching close parenthesis ')'. For each integer, the program must find the product of the integer and its nesting level (i.e., the 
depth of the parentheses surrounding the integer). Finally, the program print the sum of those products as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
1 <= Each integer value in S <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the sum of the products based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
((((10)20)30)40)

Output:
200

Explanation:
Here the given string is ((((10)20)30)40).
10*4 + 20*3 + 30*2 + 40*1 = 200
So 200 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4(((1)2(3)4)(5)6)

Output:
40

Explanation:
Here the given string is 4(((1)2(3)4)(5)6).
4*0 + 1*3 + 2*2 + 3*3 + 4*2 + 5*2 + 6*1 = 40
So 40 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
(5)7((24(6)))

Output:
71

Explanation:
Here the given string is (5)7((24(6))).
5*1 + 7*0 + 24*2 + 6*3 = 71
So 71 is printed as the output.
