function customStringFormat
The function/method customStringFormat accepts two arguments str1 and str2. The string str1 represents a format which contains words and 
pairs of curly braces. The string str2 contains multiple words. An integer P is always present inside each pair of curly braces and it 
represents the position of a word to be replaced.

The function/method customStringFormat must replace the pair curly braces with the words from the string str2 based on the position 
inside the curly braces. Then the function must print the formatted string as the output.

Note: The integers present inside the curly braces are always valid (i.e., The string str2 will always have a word for the given 
position.).

Your task is to implement the function customStringFormat so that the program runs successfully.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= P < 100

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
SkillRack {2} coding {1}
platform online

Output:
SkillRack online coding platform

Explanation:
The given two string values are
SkillRack {2} coding {1}
platform online
After replacing {2} with online and {1} with platform, the formatted string becomes
SkillRack online coding platform

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
The time is {1}:{2} {3}.
10 54 AM

Output:
