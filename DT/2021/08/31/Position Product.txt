ProgramID- 14157

Position Product
The program must accept N integers as the input. The value of each integer can be any integer from -N to N except 0. A positive integer 
X indicates the Xth integer from left to right. A negative integer -X indicates the Xth integer from right to left. For each integer 
among the given N integers, the program must print the product of the integer and the integer present at the position based on its value.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains N integer values separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
-2 4 1 -3 4

Output:
6 -12 -2 -3 -12

Explanation:
The given 5 integers are -2 4 1 -3 4.
1st integer: -2 * -3(2nd integer from right to left) = 6
2nd integer: 4 * -3(4th integer from left to right) = -12
3rd integer: 1 * -2(1st integer from left to right) = -2
4th integer: -3 * 1(3rd integer from right to left) = -3
5th integer: 4 * -3(4th integer from left to right) = -12

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
8
-7 5 5 2 -4 -4 -6 1

Output:
-35 -20 -20 10 16 16 -30 -7
