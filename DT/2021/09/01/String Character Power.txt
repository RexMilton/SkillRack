String Character Power
The program must accept a string S and print the string power P based on the statements below.
- When a character occurs for the first time in the string, its power is 1.
- When a character occurs for the second time or more, its power is twice the previous value. 
- P is the sum of the individual powers of the characters in S.
- A character has zero power after it has occurred more than T times in a string.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
1 <= T <= 15

Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains T.

Output Format:
The first line contains P.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
engine
10

Output:
8

Explanation:

Input:
aabaab
5

Output:
18
