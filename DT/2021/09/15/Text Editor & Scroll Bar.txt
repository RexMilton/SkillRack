Text Editor & Scroll Bar
In a text editor, the text area shows X lines, where each line contains a maximum of Y characters. The text editor never breaks a word 
into multiple lines. Initially, the text editor is empty. The program must accept a string S as the input. The string S represents the 
text to be pasted into the text editor. The text editor automatically shows a vertical scroll bar based on the lengths of the words in 
the text. In a single scroll (up/down), the text editor moves the text by one line up/down. The program must print an integer 
representing the number of times the scroll bar to be moved down to reach the last line as the output.

Note: The length of each word in S is always less than or equal to Y.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X, Y <= 100
1 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains X and Y separated by a space.
The second line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the number of times the scroll bar to be moved down to reach the last line.
