Biggest Plus Sign in Matrix
The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C containing only 0s and 1s as the input. The program must find the biggest 
plus sign (+) formed by 1s in the given matrix. Then the program must print the length of the edge of the biggest plus sign (Edge 
length = the number of cells from the middle cell of the plus sign to one of the four ends). All four edges of the plus sign must 
be equal. If the plus sign is not present in the matrix, then the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= R, C <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the length of the edge of the biggest plus sign

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6 7
0 0 1 0 1 0 1

0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 0 0

Output:
3

Explanation:
The biggest plus sign formed by 1s in the matrix is highlighted below.
