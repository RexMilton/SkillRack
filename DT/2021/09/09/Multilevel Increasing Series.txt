Multilevel Increasing Series
The program must accept two integers N and T as the input. The program must print the first T terms in the Nth level increasing series 
as given below.
Level 1: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and so on.
Level 2: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on.
Level 3: 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, and so on.
Level 4: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 29, and so on.
Level 5: 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, and so on.
Similarly, the remaining levels are formed.

In Kth level increasing series, the next term is formed by the sum of previous K terms, where the first K-1 terms are 0s and Kth term 
is 1.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 9
1 <= T <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains N and T separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the first T terms in the Nth level increasing series separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3 10

Output:
0 0 1 1 2 4 7 13 24 44

Explanation:
Here N = 3 and T = 10.
The first 10 terms in the 3rd level increasing series are printed as the output.
0 0 1 1 2 4 7 13 24 44

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6 13

Output:
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 4 8 16 32 63
