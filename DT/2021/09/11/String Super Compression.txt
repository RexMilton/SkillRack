String Super Compression
The program must accept a string S as the input. The string S contains a series of alphabet-integer pairs. The integer value in each 
pair represents the frequency of the related alphabet. The program must compress the string by merging the pairs having the same 
alphabet (i.e., a single alphabet with the total frequency. For example, "a3a5a8" can be merged like "a16", where 16 = 3 + 5 + 8). 
Finally, the program must print the compressed string as the output. The alphabets in the compressed string must be sorted in 
alphabetical order.

Note: The alphabets in S are always in lower case.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the compressed string.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
a3t4a5a8c2

Output:
a16c2t4

Explanation:
Here the given string is a3t4a5a8c2.
After compressing the string by merging the pairs having the same alphabet, the compressed string becomes a16c2t4.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
x1y1z1a2b2k10a3b3x1y1z1

Output:
a5b5k10x2y2z2
