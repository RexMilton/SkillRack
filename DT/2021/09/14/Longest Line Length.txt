Longest Line Length
The program must accept the coordinates (x, y) of N points on a graph as the input. The program must print the length of the longest 
line parallel to the x-axis that can be formed by joining two or more points. If it is not possible to form a line parallel to the 
x-axis, then the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
4 <= N <= 500
-10 <= x, y <= 10

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each contains two integers separated by a space representing the coordinates(x, y) of a point.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the length of the longest line formed or -1 based on the given conditions..

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
8
1 3
2 3
4 3
-2 -2
4 -2
0 0
-4 2
3 -2

Output:
6

Explanation:
The longest line parallel to the x-axis is formed by joining the below three points.
(-2, -2), (3, -2) and (4, -2).
So the length of the longest line is 6, which is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
0 1
1 1
-1 0
1 0
-1 -1
0 -1
1 -1

Output:
2

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
3
2 3
-2 2
3 4

Output:
-1
