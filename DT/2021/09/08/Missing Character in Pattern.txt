Missing Character in Pattern
The program must accept a string S as the input. The string S is made up of some repeated pattern of characters, but exactly one 
character is missing and it is indicated by an underscore. The program must print the missing character in the string S as the output.
Note:
- The pattern is always repeated completely at least twice.
- The string may end in the middle of a repetition of the pattern.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the missing character in the string S.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
XYZXYZX_ZXY

Output:
Y

Explanation:
Here S = "XYZXYZX_ZXY".
The pattern is "XYZ".
So the missing character is Y, which is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
_abaabaaba

Output:
a

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
A+B*A+B*A+B_

Output:
*

Example Input/Output 4:
Input:
skillrackskillrack_kill

Output:
