Split & Find Sum
The program must accept a string S containing only digits as the input. The program must split the given string into substrings of 
identical digits. Then the program must print the sum of integers formed from the substrings of S as the output.
Note: In the given string S, no digit is repeated consecutively more than 15 times.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of integers formed from the substrings of S.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
122311

Output:
37

Explanation:
Here N=122311.
After splitting the given string into substrings of identical digits, the sum of integers formed from the substrings is 37 (1 + 22 + 3 + 
11).

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
9999555566601234

Output:
16230

Explanation:
Here N=9999555566601234.
After splitting the given string into substrings of identical digits, the sum of integers formed from the substrings is 16230 (9999 + 
5555 + 666 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4).
