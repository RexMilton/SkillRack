Count Cells - Coordinates Value
The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C as the input. The program must print the number of cells having the values as same 
as the concatenation of the row and column coordinates in the matrix.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= Matrix element value <= 9999

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the number of cells having the values as same as the concatenation of the row and column 
coordinates in the matrix.
