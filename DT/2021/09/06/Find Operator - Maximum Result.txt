Find Operator - Maximum Result
The program must accept two integers X and Y as the input. The program must find an operator from the four operators (*, -, +, /), which 
returns the maximum value when the corresponding operation is performed between X and Y. If two or more operators give the same maximum 
value, then the program must print the first occurring operator in the mentioned order.

Note: The operator / indicates the integer division (i.e., It returns the quotient when X is divided by Y).

Boundary Condition(s):
-10^6 <= X, Y <= 10^6

Input Format:
The first line contains X and Y separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains a character representing the operator which gives the maximum value.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 9

Output:
*

Explanation:
Multiplication: 4 * 9 = 36
Subtraction: 4 - 9 = -5
Addition: 4 + 9 = 13
Division: 4 / 9 = 0
Here the multiplication gives the maximum value.
Hence * is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4 -10

Output:
-

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
-10 5

Output:
/

Example Input/Output 4:
Input:
2 2

Output:
*
