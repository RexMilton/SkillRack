function stringToBits
The function/method stringToBits accepts an argument str representing a string value containing only alphabets as the input.

The function/method stringToBits must find the position of each alphabet of the given string in the English alphabet set. Then the 
function must replace the odd positions by 1s and the even positions by 0s. Finally, the function must return the resulting string 
which contains 0s and 1s.

Your task is to implement the function stringToBits so that the program runs successfully.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.
