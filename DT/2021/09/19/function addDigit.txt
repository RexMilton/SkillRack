function addDigit
Please implement the function addDigit(int *arr, int SIZE, int D) so that the program executes successfully. SIZE indicates the number 
of elements in arr. D is the digit to be added. The new array returned must be terminated by a -1 indicating that the array has ended.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= D <= 9

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.
The third line contains D.

Output Format:
The first line contains N or N+1 integer values separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
1 2 3 4 4
1

Output:
1 2 3 4 5

Explanation:
12344 + 1 = 12345. The digits are separated by a space.
Hence the array returned must have the following six elements.
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1]
The last -1 indicates the end of the array.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3
9 9 9
2

Output:
1 0 0 1

Explanation:
The array returned must have the following five elements.
[1, 0, 0, 1, -1]
The last -1 indicates the end of the array.

Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
