function shiftAndCompareBits
The function/method shiftAndCompareBits accepts two arguments N and X representing two integer values.

The function/method shiftAndCompareBits must form an integer M by shifting the bits (i.e., rotating the bits) in the binary representation of N to the right by X positions. The program must return an integer representing the count of bits that are equal in N and M at the same positions.

Your task is to implement the function shiftAndCompareBits so that the program runs successfully.

IMPORTANT: Do not implement the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10 1

Output:
0

Explanation:
Here N = 10 and X = 1.
The binary representation of 10 is 1010.
After shifting the bits to the right by 1 position, the integer M = 0101.
No bits are equal in N and M at the same positions.
So 0 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
10 2

Output:
4

Explanation:
Here N = 10 and X = 2.
The binary representation of 10 is 1010.
After shifting the bits to the right by 2 positions, the integer M = 1010.
All four bits are equal in N and M at the same positions.
So 4 is printed as the output.
