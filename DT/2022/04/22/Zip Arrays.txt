Zip Arrays
The program accepts three array elements with the size of the arrays as A, B and C as the input. The program must print "Two Arrays Zip:" followed by the integers that occur in the same positions in the first two arrays in separate lines. Then the program must print "Three Arrays Zip:" followed by the integers that occur in the same positions in the three arrays in separate lines.

Your task is implement the function zipArrays so that the program runs successfully.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 5 5
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
10 20 30 40 50

Output:
Two Arrays Zip:
1 6
2 7

Three Arrays Zip:
1 6 10
2 7 20
3 8 30
