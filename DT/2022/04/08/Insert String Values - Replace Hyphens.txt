Insert String Values - Replace Hyphens
The program must accept an integer X and N pairs as the input. Each pair contains a string and an integer. The program must form a string S of length X based on the following conditions.
- Initially, all the characters in the string must be hyphens.
- For each string-integer pair(string str, integer P), the program must insert the string str into the string S starting from the position P if the string S contains L hyphens starting from the position P (where L represents the length of string str). Else the program must not modify the string S.
Finally, the program must print the modified string S as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= P <= X <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Length of each string <= 30

Input Format:
The first line contains X.
The second line contains N.
The next N lines, each contains a string value str and an integer P.

Output Format:
The first line contains the string S.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
9
4
Skill 1
Program 4
Rack 7
Rack 6

Output:
SkillRack

Explanation:
Here X=9 and N=4, the string value S is formed with the hyphens ("-") of length 9.
For the 1st pair, the string Skill is inserted into the string S starting from the position 1. Now the string S becomes Skill----.
For the 2nd pair, the string Program cannot be inserted into the string S starting from the position 4. So the string S remains the same.
For the 3rd pair, the string Rack cannot be inserted into the string S starting from the position 7. So the string S remains the same.
For the 4th pair, the string Rack is inserted into the string S starting from the position 6. Now the string S becomes SkillRack.
Hence the output is
SkillRack

Example Input/Output 2:
