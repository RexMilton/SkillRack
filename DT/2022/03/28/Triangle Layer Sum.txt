Triangle Layer Sum
A matrix having (N+1)/2 rows and N columns (where N is odd) is passed as the input. A triangle with non-zero values is present in the middle of the matrix. The program must print the sum of the values in the boundary of the triangle.

Boundary Condition(s):
5 <= N <= 49

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next (N+1)/2 lines, each contains N integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of integer values in the boundary of the triangle.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
0 0 1 0 0
0 6 5 2 0
3 5 4 9 8

Output:
38

Explanation:
The integer values along the boundary are 1, 2, 8, 9, 4, 5, 3 and 6.
Their sum is 38, which is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
0 0 0 3 0 0 0
0 0 9 4 8 0 0
0 8 6 7 9 5 0
1 4 4 8 5 7 1

Output:
63
Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
