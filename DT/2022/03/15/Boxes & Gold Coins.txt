Boxes & Gold Coins
N boxes are arranged in a row. Each box contains a certain number of gold coins. Every day a boy comes and picks up the boxes only if the number of gold coins in the selected box is greater than to its left. The program must accept N integers representing the number of gold coins in the N boxes as the input. The program must print the minimum number of days that he can pick the boxes as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Number of gold coins in each box <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space representing the number of gold coins in the N boxes.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the minimum number of days that he can pick the boxes based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10
7 6 9 8 5 8 4 2 2 11

Output:
2

Explanation:
Initially, the 10 boxes are 7 6 9 8 5 8 4 2 2 11.
Day 1: He can pick the 3rd, 6th and 10th boxes.
After day 1, the boxes become 7 6 8 5 4 2 2.
Day 2: He can pick the 3rd box.
After day 2, the boxes become 7 6 5 4 2 2.
Day 3: Now he has no boxes to pick.
So 2 printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
5 4 7 3 6 9 8

Output:
2

Explanation:
Initially, the 7 boxes are 5 4 7 3 6 9 8.
Day 1: He can pick the 3rd, 5th and 6th boxes.
After day 1, the boxes become 5 4 3 8.
Day 2: He can pick the 4th box.
After day 2, the boxes become 5 4 3.
Day 3: Now he has no boxes to pick.
So 2 printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
9
7 8 9 1 5 4 3 6 2

Output:
4
