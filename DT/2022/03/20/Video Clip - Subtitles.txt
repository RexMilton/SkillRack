Video Clip - Subtitles
There are N subtitles in a video. A boy wants to know the subtitles present in a video clip that starts from X to Y. The format of the time is MM:SS. The maximum length of the video is always less than 1 hour.
The program must accept the N subtitles and the values of X, Y as the input. Each subtitle has a start time, the content and the number of seconds it lasts T. For each second in the video clip, the program must print the time (MM:SS) followed by the content of the subtitle as the output. If two or more subtitles are present in a second, then the program must print those subtitles separated by the pipe symbol (|) in the order of their occurrence. If there is no subtitle in the video clip, the program must print -1 as the output.
Note: The N subtitles are always given in chronological order.
