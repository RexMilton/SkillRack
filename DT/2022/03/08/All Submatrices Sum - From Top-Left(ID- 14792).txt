The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C as the input. The program must find all possible submatrices starting from the top-left cell of the given matrix. Then the program must print the sum of each submatrix as shown in the Example Input/Output section.

Hint: Optimize your logic to avoid Time Limit Exceeded Error.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 500
1 <= Matrix element value <= 10^4

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integers separated by a space representing the R*C matrix.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C integers separated by a space representing the of submatrices sum based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Output:
1 3 6
5 12 21
12 27 45

Explanation:
1 -> (1)
3 -> (1+2)
6 -> (1+2+3)
5 -> (1+4)
12 -> (1+2+4+5)
21 -> (1+2+3+4+5+6)
12 -> (1+4+7)
27 -> (1+2+4+5+7+8)
45 -> (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9)

Input:
4 5
70 40 20 50 20
30 10 60 50 90
80 60 20 60 70
10 30 30 10 10

Output:
70 110 130 180 200
100 150 230 330 440
180 290 390 550 730
