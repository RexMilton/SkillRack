Minimum - Maximum in Subarrays
The program must accept an integer array of size N and an integer K as the input. The program must find the maximum value in each subarray of size K in the given array. Then the program must print the minimum value among those maximum values as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= K <= N <= 10^4
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^8

Input Format:
The first line contains N and K separated by a space.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the minimum value among the obtained maximum values.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10 4
38 6 24 47 51 60 45 22 35 59

Output:
47

Explanation:
Here N = 10 and K = 4.
1st subarray -> 38 6 24 47 -> Maximum = 47
2nd subarray -> 6 24 47 51 -> Maximum = 51
3rd subarray -> 24 47 51 60 -> Maximum = 60
4th subarray -> 47 51 60 45 -> Maximum = 60
5th subarray -> 51 60 45 22 -> Maximum = 60
6th subarray -> 60 45 22 35 -> Maximum = 60
7th subarray -> 45 22 35 59 -> Maximum = 59
The minimum value among the obtained maximum values is 47.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
10 3
2 1 6 4 6 7 3 3 1 4

Output:
3
