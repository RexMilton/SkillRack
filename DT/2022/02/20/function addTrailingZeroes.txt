function addTrailingZeroes
The function/method addTrailingZeroes accepts two arguments - SIZE and arr. The integer SIZE represents the size of the integer array arr.

The function/method addTrailingZeroes must find the number of digits K in the largest integer in the given array. Then the function must add the trailing zeroes to the integers so that each integer in the array contains K digits. Finally, the function must print the sum of N revised integers.

Your task is to implement the function addTrailingZeroes so that the program runs successfully.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
12 506 7 6893

Output:
20153

Explanation:
Here N = 4.
The largest integer among the 4 integers is 6893.
The number of digits in 6893 is 4.
After adding the trailing zeroes to the integers based on the given conditions, the integers become
1200 5060 7000 6893
The sum of the 4 revised integers is 20153 which is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5
600 12 40 78 147

Output:
2047
