Remove Preceding Alphabets and Sort
The program must accept N string values containing only lower case alphabets as the input. All string values start with the same alphabet, but a certain number (possibly 0) of other alphabets appear before each string value. The program must remove those alphabets before each string, then the program must print the string values in sorted order.
Note: There will be exactly one common character in the given N string values.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= Length of each string <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each contains N string values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first N lines contain the string values in sorted order.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
pqreight
cdgelephant
xyeat
abeagle
hijklegg

Output:
eagle
eat
egg
eight
elephant

Explanation:
Here N=5.
After removing the extra alphabets before each string, the string values become
eight
elephant
eat
eagle
egg

So the 5 string values are printed in sorted order.
eagle
eat
egg
eight
elephant

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
abafruit
egfrog
kfood
oipfish

Output:
fish
food
frog
fruit
