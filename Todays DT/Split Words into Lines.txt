Split Words into Lines
The program must accept a string S containing multiple words and an integer K as the input. The program must print YES if it is possible to print the words on separate lines based on the following conditions.
- Each line except the last line must have exactly K characters including the space characters.
- The last line must have less than or equal to K characters including the space characters.
- There should be no leading space in each line.
- Only complete words are allowed in each line.
- If there is a space between two words, then the space is must when printing on the same line. But the space is optional when printing on different lines (i.e., only one trailing space is allowed when printing two words on different lines).
If it is not possible, the program must print NO as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000
1 <= K <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains a string S.
The second line contains K.

Output Format:
