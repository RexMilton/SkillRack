function getTotalDuration
The function/method getTotalDuration accepts an argument str representing a string value. The string str contains the duration of a certain number of videos (in 24-hr format HH:MM:SS) separated by a space.

The function/method getTotalDuration must return the total duration of the videos in days, hours, minutes and seconds.

Your task is to implement the function getTotalDuration so that the program runs successfully.

The following structure is used to represent the Duration and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition again in your code).
struct Duration
{
    int days;
    int hours;
    int minutes;
    int seconds;
};
IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.
