Smallest Binary Number Sum
The program must accept N integers as the input. For each integer X among the N integers, the program must find the smallest positive integer whose binary representation B is divisible by X (Consider B as a decimal number while performing division operation). Then the program must print the sum of the N resulting smallest integers as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N, Each integer value <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the sum of the N resulting smallest integers.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
12 8 23 19

Output:
114

Explanation:
1st integer 12: 28 -> 11100 (11100 is divisible by 12)
2nd integer 8: 8 -> 1000 (1000 is divisible by 8)
3rd integer 23: 53 -> 110101 (110101 is divisible by 23)
4th integer 19: 25 -> 11001 (11001 is divisible by 19)
28 + 8 + 53 + 25 = 114.
Hence 114 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3
54 63 50

Output:
2785
