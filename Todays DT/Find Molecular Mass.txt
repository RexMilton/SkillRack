Find Molecular Mass
The program must accept a string S representing a chemical formula as the input. The program must print the molecular mass for the given chemical formula as the output. The given chemical formula contains the following elements (Element Name -> Symbol -> Atomic Mass).
Hydrogen -> H -> 1
Helium -> He -> 4
Carbon -> C -> 12
Nitrogen -> N -> 14
Oxygen -> O -> 16
Magnesium -> Mg -> 24
Sulfur -> S -> 32
Calcium -> Ca -> 40
Copper -> Cu -> 63

Boundary Conditions(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer value representing the molecular mass for the given chemical formula.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
H2O

Output:
18

Explanation:
H2O -> 2 Hydrogen and 1 Oxygen
Molecular Mass = (2 * 1) + 16 = 18.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
C3H8O3

Output:
92

Explanation:
C3H8O3 -> 3 Carbon, 8 Hydrogen and 3 Oxygen
Molecular Mass = (3 * 12) + (8 * 1) + (3 * 16) = 92.

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
CuSO4

Output:
159

Example Input/Output 4:
Input:
C12H15

Output:
159
Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
