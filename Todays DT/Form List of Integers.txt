Form List of Integers
The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must form a list of integers based on the following conditions.
- Initially, the list is empty.
- For each integer X among the N integers, the program must add the integer X to the end of the list and then reverse the list.
Finally, the program must print the integers in the list obtained as the output.

HINT: Optimize your logic to avoid Time Limit Exceeded error.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^9

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains N integer values separated by a space representing the integers in the list obtained.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
10 20 30 40

Output:
40 20 10 30

Explanation:
Initially, the list is empty [].
1st integer: [] -> [10] -> [10].
2nd integer: [10] -> [10, 20] -> [20, 10].
3rd integer: [20, 10] -> [20, 10, 30] -> [30, 10, 20].
4th integer: [30, 10, 20] -> [30, 10, 20, 40] -> [40, 20, 10, 30].

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
11 22 33 44 55 66 77

Output:
77 55 33 11 22 44 66
Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
