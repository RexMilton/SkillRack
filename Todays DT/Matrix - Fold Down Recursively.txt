Matrix - Fold Down Recursively
The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C as the input. The value of R is always even. The program must print the output based on the following conditions.
- The program must fold the matrix downwards and merge(add the cell values) the overlapping row values. Then the program must print the resulting matrix.
- Then the program must repeat the above process on the resulting matrix till the number of rows of the matrix becomes odd.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= Matrix element value <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The lines contain the resulting matrices.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
8 5
3 6 5 4 3

9 12 9 6 4

2nd fold down:
23 19 20 17 13
17 23 15 18 10

3rd fold down:
40 42 35 35 23

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6 2
10 10
20 20
