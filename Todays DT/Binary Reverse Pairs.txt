Binary Reverse Pairs
The program must accept N odd integers and print all possible pairs of integers (X, Y) where the binary representation of X is equal to the reverse of the binary representation of Y. If there is no such pair, then the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value < 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The lines, each contains a pair of integers separated by a space or the first line contains -1.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
7
23 35 37 17 29 49 17

Output:
23 29
35 49
17 17

Explanation:
23 -> 10111
35 -> 100011
37 -> 100101
17 -> 10001
29 -> 11101
49 -> 110001
17 -> 10001
The binary representation of 23 is equal to the reverse of the binary representation of 29.
The binary representation of 35 is equal to the reverse of the binary representation of 49.
The binary representation of 17 is equal to the reverse of the binary representation of 17.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
13 91 25 21

Output:
-1

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
7
15 15 15 19 25 25 19

Output:
15 15
15 15
15 15
19 25
19 25
25 19
