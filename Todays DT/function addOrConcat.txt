function addOrConcat
The function/method addOrConcat accepts an argument str representing a string value that contains the integers and words separated by a plus symbol (+).

The function/method addOrConcat must perform the following operations on the given string.
- If two or more integers are separated by a plus symbol (+), then those integers must be replaced with their sum.
- If two or more words are separated by a plus symbol (+), then those words must be combined into a single word.
Finally, the function must return the resulting string as the output.
Note:
- Each integer value will be from 1 to 10^6.
- Each word contains only alphabets.

Your task is to implement the function addOrConcat so that the program runs successfully.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5+10+rats+cats+25+monkeys+50+100+donkeys

Output:
15+ratscats+25+monkeys+150+donkeys

Explanation:
Here the given string is 5+10+rats+cats+25+monkeys+50+100+donkeys.
After performing the addition and concatenation operations, the resulting string becomes 15+ratscats+25+monkeys+150+donkeys.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
a+b+c+d+1+2+3+4+5+alphabets+numbers

Output:
abcd+15+alphabetsnumbers
