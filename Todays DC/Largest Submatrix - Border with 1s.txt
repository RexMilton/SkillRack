Largest Submatrix - Border with 1s
The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C containing only 0s and 1s as the input. The program must print the size of the largest square submatrix of the minimum size 2 where all the elements in the border are 1s. If there is no such submatrix, then the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer value representing the size of the largest square submatrix or -1 based on the given conditions.
