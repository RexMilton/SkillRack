function multiplyOrRepeat
The function/method multiplyOrRepeat accepts an argument str. The string str contains two positive integers(X, Y) separated by an asterisk or a word(W) and a positive integer(N) separated by an asterisk.

The function/method multiplyOrRepeat must return a string based on the following conditions.
- If the given string contains two integers, then the function must return their product as a string.
- Else the function must form a string by repeating the word N times. Then the function must return the resulting string.

Your task is to implement the function multiplyOrRepeat so that the program runs successfully.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
15*120

Output:
1800

Explanation:
The given string contains two integers(15 and 120) separated by an asterisk.
So their product is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
Skill*4

Output:
SkillSkillSkillSkill

Explanation:
The given string contains a word and an integer("Skill" and 4) separated by an asterisk.
So the word "Skill" is repeated 4 times.

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
10*CSE

Output:
CSECSECSECSECSECSECSECSECSECSE
Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
