function getArrayFromString
The function/method getArrayFromString accepts two arguments str and K representing a string value and an integer value respectively. The string str contains only digits.

The function/method getArrayFromString must form K-digit integers from the given string based on the following conditions.
- For every K digits in the given string, the function must form an integer. If there are leading zeroes in the K digits, then the function must move those leading zeroes to the end and form the integer.
Then the function must return an array containing those K-digit integers.

Note:
- The length of the string is always divisible by K.
- There will be at least one nonzero digit in every K digits.

Your task is to implement the function getArrayFromString so that it passes all test cases.

The following structure is used to represent the boundedArray and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition again in your code).
typedef struct BoundedArray
{
    int SIZE;
    int *arr;
} boundedArray;

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
121021562005468058
3

Output:
121 210 562 500 468 580

Explanation:
Here the given string is 121021562005468058 and the value of K is 3.
The 3-digit integers formed from the string are given below.
121 -> 121
021 -> 210
562 -> 562
005 -> 500
468 -> 468
058 -> 580

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
50000004
4

Output:
5000 4000
