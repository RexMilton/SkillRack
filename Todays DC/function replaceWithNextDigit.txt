function replaceWithNextDigit
The function/method replaceWithNextDigit accepts an argument N representing an integer value.

The function/method replaceWithNextDigit must print the output based on the following conditions.
- For each digit D in the integer N, the program must form a new integer by replacing the digit with its next digit (for the digit 9, consider 0 as the next digit).
- Then the program must print the resulting integers in sorted order.

Your task is to implement the function replaceWithNextDigit so that the program runs successfully.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
12543

Output:
12544 12553 12643 13543 22543

Explanation:
For the 1st digit: 12543 -> 22543
For the 2nd digit: 12543 -> 13543
For the 3rd digit: 12543 -> 12643
For the 4th digit: 12543 -> 12553
For the 5th digit: 12543 -> 12544
So the resulting 5 integers are printed in sorted order.
12544 12553 12643 13543 22543

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
860679

Output:
860670 860689 860779 861679 870679 960679

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
999

Output:
99 909 990
Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
