function getIntegersWithSameEnds
The function/method getIntegersWithSameEnds accepts two arguments str and K. The first argument str represents a string value containing only digits. The second argument K represents an integer value.

The function/method getIntegersWithSameEnds must form all possible K-digit integers with the same ends using the consecutive digits in the given string. Then the program must return an array of integers containing the resulting K-digit integers in sorted order. If there is no such K-digit integer, then the function must return an array of size 1 with the value as -1.

Note: K-digit integers do not have leading zeroes.

Your task is to implement the function getIntegersWithSameEnds so that it passes all the test cases.

The following structure is used to represent the boundedArray and is already defined in the default code (Do not write this definition again in your code).
typedef struct BoundedArray
{
    int SIZE;
    int *arr;
} boundedArray;
IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
2 <= K <= 9

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
508562102042022
4

Output:
2022 2042 2102 5085

Explanation:
Here K = 4.
The 4-digit integers with the same ends that can be formed from the string are given below.
5085, 2102, 2042 and 2022
After sorting the 4-digit integers, the integers become
2022 2042 2102 5085
