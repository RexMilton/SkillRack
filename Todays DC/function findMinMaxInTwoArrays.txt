function findMinMaxInTwoArrays
The function/method findMinMaxInTwoArrays accepts five arguments - SIZE1, arr1, SIZE2, arr2 and K. The integer SIZE1 represents the size of the integer array arr1. The integer SIZE2 represents the size of the integer array arr2. K represents an integer value.

The function/method findMinMaxInTwoArrays must find the count of integers greater than K in the array arr1 as X and the count of integers smaller than K in the array arr2 as Y. Then the function must return an integer representing the maximum value between X and Y.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 6
10 17 13 6 16
15 8 23 6 33 78
10

Output:
3

Explanation:
Here K = 10.
There are 3 integers greater than 10 in the 1st array -> 17, 13 and 16.
There are 2 integers smaller than 10 in the 2nd array -> 8 and 6.
The maximum value between 3 and 2 is 3.
Hence 3 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7 6
68 92 94 12 34 93 14
90 27 37 26 12 83
50

Output:
4
