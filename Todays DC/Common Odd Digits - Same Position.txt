Common Odd Digits - Same Position
The program must accept two integers X and Y as the input. The program must print the integer formed by the common odd digits in the same positions starting from the unit digit of X and Y as the output.

Note: There will be at least one common odd digit in X and Y at the same position.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X, Y <= 10^8

Input Format:
The first line contains X.
The second line contains Y.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer value based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
1234599
31579

Output:
359

Explanation:
Here the common odd digits starting from the unit digit position are 9, 5 and 3.
So the integer is 359 which is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
12345
12435

Output:
15
