Daily Challenge ProgramID- 13968  SkillRack
Move to Beginning - Operations Count
The program must accept a string S and two integers X, Y as the input. The program must perform the following two operations alternately on the given string S until the string becomes the original string.
- Move the last X characters to the beginning.
- Move the last Y characters to the beginning.
Finally, the program must print the number of operations performed on the given string S as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
1 <= X, Y <= Length of S

Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains X and Y separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the number of operations performed on the given string S.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
high
1 2

Output:
3

Explanation:
Here X = 1 and Y = 2.
1st operation: high -> hhig
2nd operation: hhig -> ighh
3rd operation: ighh -> high

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
SkillRack
3 1

Output:
13

Explanation:
Here X = 3 and Y = 1.
1st operation: SkillRack -> ackSkillR
2nd operation: ackSkillR -> RackSkill
3rd operation: RackSkill -> illRackSk
4th operation: illRackSk -> killRackS
5th operation: killRackS -> ckSkillRa
6th operation: ckSkillRa -> ackSkillR
7th operation: ackSkillR -> llRackSki
8th operation: llRackSki -> illRackSk
9th operation: illRackSk -> kSkillRac
10th operation: kSkillRac -> ckSkillRa
11th operation: ckSkillRa -> lRackSkil
12th operation: lRackSkil -> llRackSki
13th operation: llRackSki -> SkillRack
Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
