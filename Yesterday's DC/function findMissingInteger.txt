function findMissingInteger
The function/method findMissingInteger accepts three arguments R, C and matrix. The integers R and C represent the size of the integer matrix. The given matrix contains a series of R*C consecutive positive integers but exactly one integer is missing. The missing integer is denoted by -1 in the matrix.

The function/method findMissingInteger must find the missing integer and replace -1 with the missing integer in the matrix.

Note: The first and last values in the series of R*C consecutive positive integers are always present in the matrix.

Your task is to implement the function findMissingInteger so that the program runs successfully.

IMPORTANT: Do not implement the main() function as it is already defined.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3 3
2 9 7
6 3 1
-1 5 8

Output:
2 9 7
6 3 1
4 5 8

Explanation:
Here R = 3 and C = 3.
The matrix contains all the positive integers from 1 to 9, but 4 is missing.
Hence -1 is replaced with 4.
2 9 7
6 3 1
4 5 8

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5 4
30 23 21 28
29 19 11 25
22 13 15 -1

26 24 16 12

Output:
30 23 21 28
29 19 11 25
22 13 15 27
20 17 18 14
26 24 16 12
